# Keyfigurator

This is the back-end for Archetype's Configurator.

## Installation

This back-end uses Laravel, via Sail.

1. Start Docker Desktop after installing it from the website.
2. Run `./vendor/bin/sail up` to spin up Laravel Sail. It does not use all of the associated images (such as Meilisearch), but they were left on and enabled for simplicity.
